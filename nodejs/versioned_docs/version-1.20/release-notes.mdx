## [v1.20.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.20.0)

### Highlights


- New options for methods [`page.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-screenshot), [`locator.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-screenshot) and [`elementHandle.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle#element-handle-screenshot):
  * Option `animations: "disabled"` rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state.
  * Option `mask: Locator[]` masks given elements, overlaying them with pink `#FF00FF` boxes.
- [`expect().toMatchSnapshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#screenshot-assertions-to-match-snapshot) now supports anonymous snapshots: when snapshot name is missing, Playwright Test will generate one
  automatically:

  ```js
  expect('Web is Awesome <3').toMatchSnapshot();
  ```
- New `maxDiffPixels` and `maxDiffPixelRatio` options for fine-grained screenshot comparison using [`expect().toMatchSnapshot()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#screenshot-assertions-to-match-snapshot):

  ```js
  expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot({
    maxDiffPixels: 27, // allow no more than 27 different pixels.
  });
  ```

  It is most convenient to specify `maxDiffPixels` or `maxDiffPixelRatio` once in [`TestConfig.expect`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-expect).
- Playwright Test now adds [`TestConfig.fullyParallel`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-fully-parallel) mode. By default, Playwright Test parallelizes between files. In fully parallel mode, tests inside a single file are also run in parallel. You can also use `--fully-parallel` command line flag.

  ```ts
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default {
    fullyParallel: true,
  };
  ```

- [`TestProject.grep`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-grep) and [`TestProject.grepInvert`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-grep-invert) are now configurable per project. For example, you can now
  configure smoke tests project using `grep`:
  ```ts
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default {
    projects: [
      {
        name: 'smoke tests',
        grep: '@smoke',
      },
    ],
  };
  ```
- [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer) now shows [API testing requests](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-api-testing).
- [`locator.highlight()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-highlight) visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.

## [v1.19.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.19.0)

### Version 1.19


### Playwright Test Updates


#### Soft assertions

Playwright Test v1.19 now supports **soft assertions**. Failed soft assertions **do not** terminate test execution, but mark the test as failed. Read more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#soft-assertions).

  ```js
  // Make a few checks that will not stop the test when failed...
  await expect.soft(page.locator('#status')).toHaveText('Success');
  await expect.soft(page.locator('#eta')).toHaveText('1 day');

  // ... and continue the test to check more things.
  await page.locator('#next-page').click();
  await expect.soft(page.locator('#title')).toHaveText('Make another order');
  ```

#### Custom error messages

You can now specify a [**custom error message**](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#custom-error-message) as a second argument to the `expect` and `expect.soft` functions, for example:

  ```js
  await expect(page.locator('text=Name'), 'should be logged in').toBeVisible();
  ```

  The error would look like this:

  ```bash
      Error: should be logged in

      Call log:
        - expect.toBeVisible with timeout 5000ms
        - waiting for selector "text=Name"


        2 |
        3 | test('example test', async({ page }) => {
      > 4 |   await expect(page.locator('text=Name'), 'should be logged in').toBeVisible();
          |                                                                  ^
        5 | });
        6 |
  ```

#### Parallel mode in file

By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you can now
  run them in parallel with [`method: test.describe.configure`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-configure):

  ```js
  import { test } from '@playwright/test';

  test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });

  test('parallel 1', async () => {});
  test('parallel 2', async () => {});
  ```


### [⚠️](https://emojipedia.org/warning/#:~:text=A%20triangle%20with%20an%20exclamation,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.) Potentially breaking change in Playwright Test Global Setup


It is unlikely that this change will affect you, no action is required if your tests keep running as they did.

We've noticed that in rare cases, the set of tests to be executed was configured in the global setup by means of the environment variables. We also noticed some applications that were post processing the reporters' output in the global teardown. If you are doing one of the two, [learn more](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/12018)


### Locator Updates


#### Locator now supports a `has` option that makes sure it contains another locator inside:


  ```js
  await page.locator('article', {
    has: page.locator('.highlight'),
  }).locator('button').click();
  ```

  The snippet above will select article that has highlight in it and will press the button in it.
  Read more in [locator documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has)

### Other Updates


- New [`method: Locator.page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-page)
- [`method: Page.screenshot`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-screenshot) and [`method: Locator.screenshot`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-screenshot) now automatically hides blinking caret
- Playwright Codegen now generates locators and frame locators
- New option `url`  in [`testConfig.webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig#test-config-web-server) to ensure your web server is ready before running the tests
- New [`property: TestInfo.errors`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo#test-info-errors) and [`property: TestResult.errors`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult#test-result-errors) that contain all failed assertions and soft assertions.

### Browser Versions

## [v1.18.1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.18.1)

### Highlights


This patch includes improvements to the TypeScript support and the following bug fixes:

https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11550 - [REGRESSION]: Errors inside route handler does not lead to unhandled rejections anymore
https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/11552 - [BUG] Could not resolve "C:\repo\framework\utils" in file C:\repo\tests\test.ts.

### Browser Versions


- Chromium 99.0.4812.0
- Mozilla Firefox 95.0
- WebKit 15.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels:

- Google Chrome 97
- Microsoft Edge 97




## [v1.18.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.18.0)

### Locator Improvements


- [`locator.dragTo(locator)`]
- [`expect(locator).toBeChecked({ checked })`]
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains: 
    ```js
    await page.locator('li', { hasText: 'my item' }).locator('button').click();
    ```
    Read more in [locator documentation].


### Testing API improvements


- [`expect(response).toBeOK()`]
- [`testInfo.attach()`]
- [`test.info()`]

### Improved TypeScript Support


1. Playwright Test now respects `tsconfig.json`'s [`baseUrl`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl) and [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths), so you can use aliases
1. There is a new environment variable `PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM` that allows importing ESM modules in your TS code, without the need for the compile step. Don't forget the `.js` suffix when you are importing your esm modules. Run your tests as follows:

```bash
npm i --save-dev @playwright/test@1.18.0
PW_EXPERIMENTAL_TS_ESM=1 npx playwright test
```

### Create Playwright


The `npm init playwright` command is now generally available for your use:

```sh
### Run from your project's root directory

npm init playwright
### Or create a new project

npm init playwright new-project
```

This will scaffold everything needed to get started with Playwright Test: configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test `example.spec.ts`.


### New APIs & changes


- new [`testCase.repeatEachIndex`] API
- [`acceptDownloads`] option now defaults to `true`

### Breaking change: custom config options


Custom config options are a convenient way to parametrize projects with different values. Learn more in the [parametrization guide].

Previously, any fixture introduced through [`test.extend`] could be overridden in the [`testProject.use`] config section. For example,

```js
// WRONG: THIS SNIPPET DOES NOT WORK SINCE v1.18.

// fixtures.js
const test = base.extend({
  myParameter: 'default',
});

// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: {
    myParameter: 'value',
  },
};
```

The proper way to make a fixture parametrized in the config file is to specify `option: true` when defining the fixture. For example,

```js
// CORRECT: THIS SNIPPET WORKS SINCE v1.18.

// fixtures.js
const test = base.extend({
  // Fixtures marked as "option: true" will get a value specified in the config,
  // or fallback to the default value.
  myParameter: ['default', { option: true }],
});

// playwright.config.js
module.exports = {
  use: {
    myParameter: 'value',
  },
};
```

## [v1.17.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

### Frame Locators


Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators] - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`page.frameLocator(selector)`] or [`locator.frameLocator(selector)`] method.

```js
const locator = page.frameLocator('#my-iframe').locator('text=Submit');
await locator.click();
```

Read more at [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update

## [v1.16.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

### 🎭 Playwright Test


### API Testing


Playwright 1.16 introduces new [API Testing] that lets you send requests to the server directly from Node.js!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`page.request`] API**:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
  // Do a GET request on behalf of page
  const response = await page.request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
  // ... 
});
```

To do a stand-alone request from node.js to an API endpoint, use **new [`request` fixture]**:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ request }) => {
  // Do a GET request on behalf of page
  const response = await request.get('http://example.com/foo.json');
  // ... 
});
```

Read more about it in our [API testing guide].

### Response Interception


It is now possible to do response interception by combining [API Testing] with [request interception].

For example, we can blur all the images on the page:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import jimp from 'jimp'; // image processing library

test('response interception', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/*.jpeg', async route => {
    const response = await page._request.fetch(route.request());
    const image = await jimp.read(await response.body());
    await image.blur(5);
    route.fulfill({
      response,
      body: await image.getBufferAsync('image/jpeg'),
    });
  });
  const response = await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
});
```

Read more about [response interception].

### New HTML reporter


Try it out new HTML reporter with either `--reporter=html` or a `reporter` entry
in `playwright.config.ts` file:

```bash
$ npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

The HTML reporter has all the information about tests and their failures, including surfacing
trace and image artifacts.

![html reporter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/138324311-94e68b39-b51a-4776-a446-f60037a77f32.png)

Read more about [our reporters].

### 🎭 Playwright Library


### locator.waitFor


Wait for a locator to resolve to a single element with a given state.
Defaults to the `state: 'visible'`.

Comes especially handy when working with lists:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('context fetch', async ({ page }) => {
  const completeness = page.locator('text=Success');
  await completeness.waitFor();
  expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchSnapshot('screen.png');
});
```

Read more about [`locator.waitFor()`].

### 🎭 Playwright Trace Viewer


- web-first assertions inside trace viewer
- run trace viewer with `npx playwright show-trace` and drop trace files to the trace viewer PWA
- API testing is integrated with trace viewer
- better visual attribution of action targets

Read more about [Trace Viewer].

## [v1.15.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

### 🎭 Playwright Library


### 🖱️ Mouse Wheel


By using [`Page.mouse.wheel`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-wheel) you are now able to scroll vertically or horizontally.

### 📜 New Headers API


Previously it was not possible to get multiple header values of a response. This is now  possible and additional helper functions are available:

- [Request.allHeaders()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-all-headers)
- [Request.headersArray()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-headers-array)
- [Request.headerValue(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-header-value)
- [Response.allHeaders()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-all-headers)
- [Response.headersArray()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-headers-array)
- [Response.headerValue(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response#response-header-value)
- [Response.headerValues(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-response/#response-header-values)

### 🌈 Forced-Colors emulation


Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-forced-colors) or calling [Page.emulateMedia()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs


- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.
- [Request.sizes()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-sizes) Returns resource size information for given http request.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.startChunk()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-chunk) - Start a new trace chunk.
- [BrowserContext.tracing.stopChunk()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-stop-chunk) - Stops a new trace chunk.

### 🎭 Playwright Test


### 🤝 `test.parallel()` run tests in the same file in parallel


```ts
test.describe.parallel('group', () => {
  test('runs in parallel 1', async ({ page }) => {
  });
  test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => {
  });
});
```

By default, tests in a single file are run in order. If you have many independent tests in a single file, you can now run them in parallel with [test.describe.parallel(title, callback)](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-parallel).

### 🛠 Add `--debug` CLI flag


By using `npx playwright test --debug` it will enable the [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector) for you to debug your tests.

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.14.0)

### 🎭 Playwright Library


### ⚡️ New "strict" mode


Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict: true` into your action calls to opt in.

```js
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.click('button', { strict: true });
```

### 📍 New [**Locators API**](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator)


Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```js
const locator = page.locator('button');
await locator.click();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator).

### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines


React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```js
await page.click('_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]');
await page.click('_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]');
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#vue-selectors).

### ✨ New [**`nth`**](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines


- [`nth`](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```js
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.click('button >> nth=0');
// or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()
await page.locator('button').first().click();

// click a visible button
await button.click('button >> visible=true');
```

### 🎭 Playwright Test


### ✅ Web-First Assertions


`expect` now supports lots of new web-first assertions.

Consider the following example:

```js
await expect(page.locator('.status')).toHaveText('Submitted');
```

Playwright Test will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is reached. You can either pass this timeout or configure it once via the [`testProject.expect`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject/#test-project-expect) value in test config.

By default, the timeout for assertions is not set, so it'll wait forever, until the whole test times out.

List of all new assertions:

- [`expect(locator).toBeChecked()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobechecked)
- [`expect(locator).toBeDisabled()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobedisabled)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEditable()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobeeditable)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEmpty()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobeempty)
- [`expect(locator).toBeEnabled()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobeenabled)
- [`expect(locator).toBeFocused()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobefocused)
- [`expect(locator).toBeHidden()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobehidden)
- [`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortobevisible)
- [`expect(locator).toContainText(text, options?)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortocontaintexttext-options)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveAttribute(name, value)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveattributename-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveClass(expected)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveclassexpected)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveCount(count)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohavecountcount)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveCSS(name, value)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohavecssname-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveId(id)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohaveidid)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveJSProperty(name, value)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohavejspropertyname-value)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveText(expected, options)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohavetextexpected-options)
- [`expect(page).toHaveTitle(title)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectpagetohavetitletitle)
- [`expect(page).toHaveURL(url)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectpagetohaveurlurl)
- [`expect(locator).toHaveValue(value)`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions#expectlocatortohavevaluevalue)

### ⛓ Serial mode with [`describe.serial`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-serial)


Declares a group of tests that should always be run serially. If one of the tests fails, all subsequent tests are skipped. All tests in a group are retried together.

```ts
test.describe.serial('group', () => {
  test('runs first', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
  test('runs second', async ({ page }) => { /* ... */ });
});
```

Learn more in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-serial).

### 🐾 Steps API with [`test.step`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-step)


Split long tests into multiple steps using `test.step()` API:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step('Log in', async () => {
    // ...
  });
  await test.step('news feed', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

Step information is exposed in reporters API.

### 🌎 Launch web server before running tests


To launch a server during the tests, use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-advanced/#launching-a-development-web-server-during-the-tests) option in the configuration file. The server will wait for a given port to be available before running the tests, and the port will be passed over to Playwright as a [`baseURL`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fixtures#fixtures-base-url) when creating a context.

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { PlaywrightTestConfig } from '@playwright/test';
const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start', // command to launch
    port: 3000, // port to await for 
    timeout: 120 * 1000, 
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
};
export default config;
```

## [v1.12.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.12.0)

### ⚡️ Introducing Playwright Test


[Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/test-intro) is a **new test runner** built from scratch by Playwright team specifically to accommodate end-to-end testing needs:

- Run tests across all browsers.
- Execute tests in parallel.
- Enjoy context isolation and sensible defaults out of the box.
- Capture traces, videos, screenshots and other artifacts on failure.
- Infinitely extensible with fixtures.

Installation:
```bash
npm i -D @playwright/test
```

Simple test `tests/foo.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const name = await page.innerText('.navbar__title');
  expect(name).toBe('Playwright');
});
```

Running:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

👉  Read more in [testrunner documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/test-intro).

### 🧟‍♂️ Introducing Playwright Trace & TraceViewer


[Playwright TraceViewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/trace-viewer) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browse network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`browserContext.tracing`] API:

```ts
const browser = await chromium.launch();
const context = await browser.newContext();

// Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
await context.tracing.start({ screenshots: true, snapshots: true });

const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');

// Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
await context.tracing.stop({ path: 'trace.zip' });
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:

👉 Read more in [trace viewer documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/next/trace-viewer).
