## [v1.18.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v1.18.0)

### API Testing


Playwright for Java 1.18 introduces new [API Testing](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Java!

Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`page.request()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/next/api/class-page#page-request) API**:

```java
// Do a GET request on behalf of page
APIResponse res = page.request().get("http://example.com/foo.json");
```

Read more about it in our [API testing guide](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/test-api-testing).

### Web-First Assertions


Playwright for Java 1.18 introduces [Web-First Assertions](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-playwrightassertions).

Consider the following example:

```java
...
import static com.microsoft.playwright.assertions.PlaywrightAssertions.assertThat;

public class TestExample {
  ...
  @Test
  void statusBecomesSubmitted() {
    ...
    page.click("#submit-button");
    assertThat(page.locator(".status")).hasText("Submitted");
  }
}
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-playwrightassertions).

### Locator Improvements


- [`Locator.dragTo()`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/next/api/class-locator#locator-drag-to)
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:
    ```java
    page.locator("li", new Page.LocatorOptions().setHasText("my item"))
        .locator("button").click();
    ```
    Read more in [locator documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has-text)

### Tracing Improvements


[Tracing](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-tracing.md) now can embed Java sources to recorded
traces, using new [`setSources`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-sources) option.

![tracing-java-sources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/150180856-40a7df71-370c-4597-8665-40c77a5e06ad.png)

## [v1.17.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

### Playwright v1.17.0


### Frame Locators


Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators] - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`page.FrameLocator(selector)`] or [`locator.FrameLocator(selector)`] method.

```java
Locator locator = page.frameLocator("#my-frame").locator("text=Submit");
locator.click();
```

Read more at [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update


Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

- [Response.headerValues(name: string)](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-response/#response-header-values)

### 🌈 Forced-Colors emulation


Its now possible to emulate the `forced-colors` CSS media feature by passing it in the [context options](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-color-scheme) or calling [Page.emulateMedia()](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-emulate-media).

### New APIs


- [Page.route()](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-route) accepts new `times` option to specify how many times this route should be matched.
- [Page.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-page#page-set-checked) and [Locator.setChecked(selector: string, checked: boolean)](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator#locator-set-checked) was introduced to set the checked state of a checkbox.

- Microsoft Edge 92



## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v1.14.0)

### ⚡️ New "strict" mode


Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Use `setStrict(true)` in your action calls to opt in.

```java
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
page.click("button", new Page.ClickOptions().setStrict(true));
```

### 📍 New [**Locators API**](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator)


Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```java
Locator locator = page.locator("button");
locator.click();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api/class-locator).

### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines


React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```java
page.click("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]");
page.click("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]");
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#vue-selectors).

### ✨ New [**`nth`**](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines


- [`nth`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```java
// select the first button among all buttons
button.click("button >> nth=0");
// or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()
page.locator("button").first().click();
// click a visible button
button.click("button >> visible=true");
```

## [v1.12.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v1.12.0)

### 🧟‍♂️ Introducing Playwright Trace & TraceViewer


[Playwright Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/next/trace-viewer) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browser network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`BrowserContext.tracing()`] API:

```java
Browser browser = chromium.launch();
BrowserContext context = Browser.newContext();

// Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.
context.tracing.start(new Tracing.StartOptions()
  .setScreenshots(true)
  .setSnapshots(true);

Page page = context.newPage();
page.goto("https://playwright.dev");

// Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.
context.tracing.stop(new Tracing.StopOptions()
  .setPath(Paths.get("trace.zip")));
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
mvn exec:java -e -Dexec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -Dexec.args="show-trace trace.zip"
```

That will open the following GUI:

## [v1.9.0-alpha-0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v1.9.0-alpha-0)

### Highlights

- Playwright goes semver. We are jumping from `0.180.*` to `1.9.0-alapha-0` to become semver compliant. This is a breaking change, but once we drop the Alpha bit, it'll be in stone for years!
- [Documentation site](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/intro) is now all about Java! It has guides, sample snippets, API docs.
- [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) is a **new GUI tool** to author and debug your tests.
  - **Line-by-line debugging** of your Playwright scripts, with play, pause and step-through. Set `PLAYWRIGHT_JAVA_SRC=<src dir>` to let debugger know location of your java sources.
  - Author new scripts by **recording user actions**.
  - **Generate element selectors** for your script by hovering over elements.
  - Set the `PWDEBUG=1` environment variable to launch the Inspector

- **Pause script execution** with [`page.pause()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#pagepause) in headed mode. Pausing the page launches [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/inspector) for debugging.

- **New has-text pseudo-class** for CSS selectors. `:has-text("example")` matches any element containing `"example"` somewhere inside, possibly in a child or a descendant element. See [more examples](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#text-selector).

- **Page dialogs are now auto-dismissed** during execution, unless a listener for `dialog` event is configured. [Learn more](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs) about this.

### Browser Versions


- Chromium 90.0.4421.0
- Mozilla Firefox 86.0b10

## [v0.181.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v0.181.0)

### Highlights


* Includes driver [v1.8.1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.8.1)
* `page.reload()` and `page.isVisible()` fixes.





## [v0.180.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/releases/tag/v0.180.0)

### Highlights


- [Selecting elements based on layout](https://playwright.dev/docs/selectors#selecting-elements-based-on-layout) with `:left-of()`, `:right-of()`, `:above()` and `:below()`
- Playwright now includes [command line interface](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli), former playwright-cli. Give it a try with ```npx playwright --help```
- [Documentation site](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) now has a lot more content, and a dedicated [python section](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)
- [`selectOption(selector, values[, options])`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page/#pageselectoptionselector-values-options) now waits for the options to be present
- New methods to [assert element state](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability#assertions) like `page.isEditable('selector')`

### API changes since the last 0.171.0 version:


* Deferred interface has been removed, use `waitFor*` methods instead:

```java
// Before
Deferred<Request> event = page.waitForRequest();
page.click("a");
Request request = event.get();
```
```java
// After
Request request = page.waitForRequest(() -> page.click("a"));

```

* Listener interface is gone, use corresponding `on*/off*` methods with typed parameter:

```java
// Before
page.addListener(Page.EventType.REQUESTFAILED, event -> {
  Request request = (Request) event.data();
  System.out.println(request.url());
});
```
```java
// After
page.onRequestFailed(request -> {
  System.out.println(request.url());
});

```
