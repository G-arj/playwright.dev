## [v1.18.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/tag/v1.18.0)

### API Testing


Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces new [API Testing](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext) that lets you send requests to the server directly from Python!
Now you can:

- test your server API
- prepare server side state before visiting the web application in a test
- validate server side post-conditions after running some actions in the browser

To do a request on behalf of Playwright's Page, use **new [`page.request`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/next/api/class-page#page-request) API**:

```python
### Do a GET request on behalf of page

res = page.request.get("http://example.com/foo.json")
```

Read more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-apirequestcontext).

### Web-First Assertions


Playwright for Python 1.18 introduces [Web-First Assertions](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-playwrightassertions).

Consider the following example:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

def test_status_becomes_submitted(page: Page) -> None:
    # ..
    page.click("#submit-button")
    expect(page.locator(".status")).to_have_text("Submitted")
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-playwrightassertions).

### Locator Improvements


- [`locator.drag_to()`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-drag-to)
- Each locator can now be optionally filtered by the text it contains:
    ```python
    page.locator("li", has_text="my item").locator("button").click()
    ```

    Read more in [locator documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator#locator-locator-option-has-text)


### New APIs & changes


- [`accept_downloads`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context-option-accept-downloads) option now defaults to `True`.
- [`sources`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-tracing#tracing-start-option-sources) option to embed sources into traces.

### Browser Versions

## [v1.17.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

### Playwright v1.17.0


### Frame Locators


Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators] - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`page.frame_locator(selector)`] or [`locator.frame_locator(selector)`] method.

```py
locator = page.frame_locator("my-frame").locator("text=Submit")
locator.click()
```

Read more at [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update


Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Playwright Test traces now include sources by default (these could be turned off with tracing option)
- Trace Viewer now shows test name
- New trace metadata tab with browser details
- Snapshots now have URL bar

## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/tag/v1.14.0)

### ⚡️ New "strict" mode


Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `strict = true` into your action calls to opt in.

```py
### This will throw if you have more than one button!

page.click('button', strict=true)
```

### 📍 New [**Locators API**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator)


Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```py
locator = page.locator('button')
locator.click()
```

Learn more in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-locator).

### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines


React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```py
page.click('_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]')
page.click('_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]')
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#vue-selectors).

### ✨ New [**`nth`**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines


- [`nth`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```py
### select the first button among all buttons

button.click('button >> nth=0')
### or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()

page.locator('button').first().click()

### click a visible button

button.click('button >> visible=true')
```

## [v1.12.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/tag/v1.12.0)

### 🧟‍♂️ Introducing Playwright Trace & TraceViewer


[Playwright Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/next/trace-viewer) is a new GUI tool that helps exploring recorded Playwright traces after the script ran. Playwright traces let you examine:
- page DOM before and after each Playwright action
- page rendering before and after each Playwright action
- browse network during script execution

Traces are recorded using the new [`browser_context.tracing`] API:

```python
browser = chromium.launch()
context = browser.new_context()

### Start tracing before creating / navigating a page.

context.tracing.start(screenshots=True, snapshots=True)

page.goto("https://playwright.dev")

### Stop tracing and export it into a zip archive.

context.tracing.stop(path = "trace.zip")
```

Traces are examined later with the Playwright CLI:


```sh
playwright show-trace trace.zip
```

That will open the following GUI:

## [v1.8.0a1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases/tag/v1.8.0a1)

### Highlights

- Playwright goes semver. We are jumping from `0.170.*` to `1.8.0a1` to become semver compliant. This is a breaking change, but once we drop the Alpha bit, it'll be in stone for years!
- [Documentation site](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro) is now all about Python! It has guides, sample snippets, API docs
- You can now [select elements based on layout](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/selectors#selecting-elements-based-on-layout) with `:left-of()`, `:right-of()`, `:above()` and `:below()`
- New methods to [assert element state](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/actionability#assertions) like `page.is_editable('selector')` were added.

### Migration from the pre-release versions


The API has changed since the last 0.170.0 version:
- Snake case notation for methods and arguments:

  ```py
  # old
  browser.newPage()
  ```
  ```py
  # new
  browser.new_page()
  ```

- Import has changed to include sync vs async mode explicitly:
  ```py
  # old
  from playwright import sync_playwright
  ```
  ```py
  # new
  from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
  ```
