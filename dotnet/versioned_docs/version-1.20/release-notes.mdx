## [N/A](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases/tag/)

### Web-First Assertions


Playwright for .NET 1.20 introduces [Web-First Assertions](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/test-assertions).

Consider the following example:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Playwright.NUnit;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace Playwright.TestingHarnessTest.NUnit
{
    public class ExampleTests : PageTest
    {
        [Test]
        public async Task StatusBecomesSubmitted()
        {
            await Expect(Page.Locator(".status")).ToHaveTextAsync("Submitted");
        }
    }
}
```

Playwright will be re-testing the node with the selector `.status` until
fetched Node has the `"Submitted"` text. It will be re-fetching the node and
checking it over and over, until the condition is met or until the timeout is
reached. You can pass this timeout as an option.

Read more in [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/next/test-assertions).

### Other Updates


- New options for methods [`page.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-page#page-screenshot), [`locator.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator#locator-screenshot) and [`elementHandle.screenshot()`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-elementhandle#element-handle-screenshot):
  * Option `ScreenshotAnimations.Disabled` rewinds all CSS animations and transitions to a consistent state
  * Option `mask: Locator[]` masks given elements, overlaying them with pink `#FF00FF` boxes.
- [`Locator.highlight()`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator#locator-highlight) visually reveals element(s) for easier debugging.

## [v1.17.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.17.0)

### Playwright v1.17.0


### Frame Locators


Playwright 1.17 introduces [frame locators] - a locator to the iframe on the page. Frame locators capture the logic sufficient to retrieve the `iframe` and then locate elements in that iframe. Frame locators are strict by default, will wait for `iframe` to appear and can be used in Web-First assertions.

![Graphics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/142082759-2170db38-370d-43ec-8d41-5f9941f57d83.png)

Frame locators can be created with either [`page.FrameLocator(selector)`] or [`locator.FrameLocator(selector)`] method.

```csharp
var locator = page.FrameLocator("#my-iframe").Locator("text=Submit");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Read more at [our documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-framelocator).

### Trace Viewer Update


Playwright Trace Viewer is now **available online** at https://trace.playwright.dev! Just drag-and-drop your `trace.zip` file to inspect its contents.

> **NOTE**: trace files are not uploaded anywhere; [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) is a [progressive web application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) that processes traces locally.

- Microsoft Edge 92



## [v1.14.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.14.0)

### ⚡️ New "strict" mode


Selector ambiguity is a common problem in automation testing. **"strict" mode**
ensures that your selector points to a single element and throws otherwise.

Pass `Strict = true` into your action calls to opt in.

```C#
// This will throw if you have more than one button!
await page.ClickAsync("button", new () { Strict = true } );
```

### 📍 New [**Locators API**](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator)


Locator represents a view to the element(s) on the page. It captures the logic sufficient to retrieve the element at any given moment.

The difference between the [Locator](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator) and [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-elementhandle) is that the latter points to a particular element, while [Locator](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator) captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

Also, locators are **"strict" by default**!

```C#
var locator = page.Locator("button");
await locator.ClickAsync();
```

Learn more in the [documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/api/class-locator).

### 🧩 Experimental [**React**](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and [**Vue**](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#vue-selectors) selector engines


React and Vue selectors allow selecting elements by its component name and/or property values. The syntax is very similar to [attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) and supports all attribute selector operators.

```C#
await page.ClickAsync("_react=SubmitButton[enabled=true]");
await page.ClickAsync("_vue=submit-button[enabled=true]");
```

Learn more in the [react selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#react-selectors) and the [vue selectors documentation](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#vue-selectors).

### ✨ New [**`nth`**](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) and [**`visible`**](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engines


- [`nth`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#n-th-element-selector) selector engine is equivalent to the `:nth-match` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.
- [`visible`](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/selectors#selecting-visible-elements) selector engine is equivalent to the `:visible` pseudo class, but could be combined with other selector engines.

```C#
// select the first button among all buttons
await button.ClickAsync("button >> nth=0");
// or if you are using locators, you can use first(), nth() and last()
await page.Locator("button").First.ClickAsync();

// click a visible button
await button.ClickAsync("button >> visible=true");
```

### .NET Specific Features


* 🧪 `SkipAttribute` We now have a `NUnit` attribute that can be used to skip various combinations of browser and/or platforms.

### Breaking Changes

This release is a major release for the .NET port. We've completely redone the API surface in order to ensure parity with the rest of the supported languages. Unfortunately, this meant we had to introduce some breaking changes. The following list points out the key ones:

* **Installation** of the browsers no longer happens automatically. Follow the steps in [Getting started](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro#first-project).
 * Optional arguments have been replaced with an `options` class. Method calls should look closer to `.LaunchAsync(new() { Headless = false });`
 * All `decimal` arguments are now `float`.
 * `IAccessibility` now returns a `JSONElement`
 * The use of `System.Drawing.Point` was dropped in favour of using our own, generated `Position`
 * `timeout` and `delay` arguments are now `float`.
 * The usage of the `Rect` class was replaced by `ElementHandleBoundingBoxResult`.
 * `WaitForState` was renamed to `WaitForSelectorState`.
 * `SelectOption` was renamed to `SelectOptionValue`.
 * `EventArg`s were removed in favor of the class the `EventArg` was wrapping. For instance `Page.Close` is now an `EventHandler<IPage>` and `Page.Download` is now an `EventHandler<IDownload>`.
 * `Modifier` was renamed to `KeyboardModifier`. 
 * `LifecycleEvent` was renamed to `LoadState`. 
 * Arrays are now exposed as `ReadOnlyCollection`.

## [v0.162.1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.162.1)

### Changelog


Add copy targets for Xamarin.Mac



## [v0.162.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.162.0)

### Major Changes

Driver updated to v.0.162.1. See playwright changelog: [v1.6.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.6.0), [v1.6.1](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.6.1) and [v1.6.2](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases/tag/v1.6.2).

### Driver and browser install refactor.


### Playwright Driver


Playwright drivers will be copied to the `bin` folder at build time. Nuget will rely on the [RuntimeIdentifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003814#runtimeidentifier) to copy a platform-specific driver, or on the [runtime used on dotnet publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003814).
If the [RuntimeIdentifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/msbuild-props?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5003814#runtimeidentifier) is not set, all runtimes will be copied inside a runtimes folder. Then, the platform-specific driver will be picked at run-time.

### Browsers


The way browsers are installed will vary depending on the use case scenario. 

#### Playwright in test projects


If you use Playwright in test projects, all required browsers will be installed at build time.

#### Using Playwright in Docker


If you use the [official Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-playwright), all the required browsers will be installed in that image. 
The minor version of the package will tell you which docker image tag to use. For instance, PlaywrightSharp 0.162.0 will work with the tag **v1.6.2**.

#### Using Playwright in a Remote Server.


If you run Playwright in a remote server. For instance, as part of a web application, you will need to run `.\bin\playwright-cli.exe install` in Windows or `./bin/playwright-cli install` in OSX/Linux as part of your deploy script. 

### New APIs

 * https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-sharp/commit/46790395f597958532991a47d5171dca6ba4250a `BrowserContextOptions` was implemented to receive a DeviceDescription in the constructor.

 * https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-sharp/commit/c9ab521e0983cdbe3abe72cde4febcc24c10813f Introduce TapAsync.

```cs
await using var context = await _browser.NewContextAsync(new BrowserContextOptions(Playwright.Devices["iPhone 6"])
{
    TimezoneId = "America/Jamaica",
    Locale = "fr-CH",
    UserAgent = "UA",
});
```
